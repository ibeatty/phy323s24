# phy323s24

For distributing files associated with UNCG's Physics 323 in Spring 2024, taught by Prof. Ian Beatty.

Dear students in PHY 323:

I've made this GitHub repo public to save you the hassle of having to create a GitHub account, and then logging in every time you want to access these solutions. Please do NOT distribute or share these beyond our class! I do tend to re-use good problems from one year to the next.

If I discover them circulating on the internet -- on Chegg, for example, or anywhere else -- I'll have to rethink how I share solutions, and the result will probably be quite a bit less convenient for all of us. I'm trusting you.

Thanks // _Prof. Beatty_
