(From the water's frame of reference, the buoy is moving in the other direction through it, and experiencing a drag force in the opposite direction of its velocity.) For the buoy to remain stationary, the tension force must now have a horizontal component to balance the drag force. This will cause the rope to deviate from vertical."
